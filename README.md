## Inside The Block

**Inside The Block** is a visual-focused mod that reimagines vanilla container blocks by making them **3D, hollow, and interactive**.

Blocks like the furnace are no longer opaque cubes — you can actually see what’s happening **inside** them in real time.

---

## Features (v1.0.0)

- 3D hollow Furnace model
- Items visibly cooking inside the Furnace in real time
- Fully synced with the Furnace’s internal state
- Purely visual — no changes to vanilla mechanics

---

## Planned Features

- Support for additional container blocks (Blast Furnace, Smoker, etc.)
- More detailed item animations
- Optional configuration settings
- Compatibility improvements and optimizations

---

## Important

- This mod currently supports **only the vanilla Furnace**
- More block entities will be added in future updates
- Suggestions and feedback are welcome!

---

Inside The Block focuses on immersion and visual clarity, making Minecraft’s world feel more alive by showing you what normally stays hidden.

*(Technically still Minecraft — just with less mystery inside your blocks!)*
